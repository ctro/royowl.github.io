I love to cook at home, and for friends.  I especially love cooking in the outdoors.  Here are a couple favorite camp-cook accessories!

[![Wilson Grill](/assets/wilsongrill.jpg)](http://amzn.to/2d40KjP)
The Wilson Grill originated next door in Wilson, WY.  It's beautiful in its simplicity: a single stake in the ground and an adjustable, floating grill.  Perfect for a 12-egg-omlette.

Sadly, no one makes "real" Wilson Grills anymore, but you can find good alternatives like this [Mountain Man Grill](http://amzn.to/2d40KjP)

[![Dutch Oven](/assets/oven.jpg)](http://amzn.to/2csMss1)
Feel like baking biscuits?  [A good Dutch Oven](http://amzn.to/2csMss1) is a camp necessity.  Put this pot right in the fire ring and sprinkle some coals on the lid.  Also great for breads, stews, pies, or 100 other things.

All this means you have to stat a fire, here are some products to make it a snap!

0. [A propane torch](http://amzn.to/2cF6xe7).  This little guy will start a fire anywhere! And he uses old, nearly empty Coleman-style propane tanks.  Yes, the kind you use for your 2-burner-stove, and for the Weber Q grill below!
0. [Fire Dragon](http://amzn.to/2d42Pfw).  Everyone who sees the Fire Dragon wants one.  It's the best campfire tool for grabbing and moving wood.  You can also **blow air into the heart of the fire to heat it up**.  So Cool.
0. Some [Heat Resistant Gloves](http://amzn.to/2cfcHGn) for holding pots or logs.

[![Weber Q](/assets/weberq.jpg)](http://amzn.to/2cD0j1G)
If you're not so into cooking on the fire, the [Weber Q](http://amzn.to/2cD0j1G) is easily the world's best portable grill. Buy it for camping and you'll probably start using it at home too ;)
