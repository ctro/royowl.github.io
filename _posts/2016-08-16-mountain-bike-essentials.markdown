I live for mountain biking in the summers.  Ribbons of singletrack challenge me and set me free.
When I'm riding my bike I don't think about anything else.

Most riders use some sort of Camelback/backpack/bladder system for water and other essentials while riding.  I really dislike the extra bulk of a backpack.  For most rides I choose to carry a minimal setup.  This may read like a love letter to [Lezyne](http://www.lezyne.com/index.php), and it sort of is.

On Trail
-------
First-thing-first: you need a **great multitool**. The diminutive [Lezyne Stainless 12](http://amzn.to/2aVhgjl) has all the essentials, and nothing extra.

A **C02 kit for air** makes a lot of sense. They're small, lightweight, and fast.  I prefer models like the [Lezyne Control Drive](http://amzn.to/2biyOLX) which can adjust the amount of air coming out instead of just letting it out in one HUGE FAST WOOSH. Control models can stop airflow, allowing you to use one air canister across multiple tires.  Tire levers?  The funny looking [Quick Stick](http://amzn.to/2btQy45) is safer, faster, and easier than anything else I've used.

Pack it all in this slick **minimal saddle bag**, the [Roll Caddy](http://amzn.to/2aVganZ).  There's even room in there for your spare tube. Now go for a ride, let your shoulders roll and your back rejoice!

It's always a good idea to practice empathy.  Especially on the trail.  It can be hard to _NOT_ spook walkers when riding up behind them on singletrack.  Bikes are so quiet these days.  **Bells are a good idea**, but find myself scaring walkers with the first big DIIIIING!  Using words like "Hello, behind you" seems to freeze about 40% of walkers in fear.  But I finally found the answer: the [TIMBER trail bell](http://amzn.to/2bizTTP). It's like a cow bell that you can turn on or off.  Turn it on when you see walkers and it jingles happily with your motion.  Turn it off when you don't need it.  Brilliant.

Are you getting thirsty yet?  Try the [Camelbak Big Chill](http://amzn.to/2aVw0z0). It's a big, **insulated water bottle** built with NASA Space Tech!  

At Home
-------
There is one piece of gear that you'll need at home, at camp, or on the road: a **bomber floor pump**.

Again, Lezyne to the rescue.  I've been using their basic model, the [Steel Floor Drive](http://amzn.to/2b7nAbp) for years.  It goes everywhere with me.  The pump is bombproof and super powerful.  The Flip Thread Chuck, used for switching between schrader and presta valves, is a marvel of simplicity.  The wood handle _feels so good_ and turns this into the perfect package.

Safety
------
I would be amiss if I didn't list my favorite bike lights. Lights are required by law in most places after sunset.  Trust me: spend this money now on lights instead of later on traffic tickets.

(Surprise!) Lezyne makes my favorite lights.  The [Macro XL 600](http://amzn.to/2aVtfxO) headlight is lightweight and BRIGHT!.  The [Zecto Drive](http://amzn.to/2aVgh2A) taillight is also very bright and features different attention-grabbing patterns. Both of these lights **recharge via USB**, and both of them attach/detach easily for switching between bikes.
