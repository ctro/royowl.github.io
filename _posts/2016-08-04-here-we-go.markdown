After a few coughs and a little puffing smoke, royowl.net lives!
We've long been aware of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) but this is my first project with it.

This is simplicity: [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to static HTML.
History managed with git.  No databases, no servers. Hosted for free on github.

Updating this site is as simple as `git push`.

**Our goal with this site is to highlight great products from Amazon Prime.
Things that we think will last for-life.  Things that we love to give as presents.  Things that people stop and ask us about.**

We're looking forward to the journey!
