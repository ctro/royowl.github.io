12-Volt power is camper lifeblood. Without it these things don't work:

- Lights
- Fridge
- Heater
- Water Pump
- C02/LP Detectors
- Power awnings and other _necessities_

12v runs your inverter and charges your computer, your phone, and your [Bose SoundLink Color](http://amzn.to/2alVERG). This little bluetooth speaker sounds great and is super tough.
I also like that it charges with a standard micro-USB cable.

The first thing to do is make sure your batteries don't suck.  Get 2 good, matched [deep cycle batteries](http://amzn.to/2aysyQm) and [wire them](http://amzn.to/2ayrEDP) in [parallel](/assets/batteryWireDiagram.jpg).

My family can use all we want for ~5 days. If you're going to spend a couple weeks off the grid you'll need to juice up.

Solar is the best option. **Most people put solar on their roof; I like to deploy my panels in the sunshine while I'm parked in the shade**.  This [Renology Solar suitcase setup](http://amzn.to/2ap74zG) is 100W and has been wonderful. Even the case it comes with top notch.

If you are sunshine-challenged a generator comes in handy.  I love our [Honda 1000](http://amzn.to/2alUmX5).  It's *so* quiet and small.  Plus, it's going to run for 100 years.

A couple benefits to the genny

- You can power-up a bunch of nomad friends if your wagons are circled
- You can use it with your [Noco smart battery charger](http://amzn.to/2ap75DO) for optimum battery life
- It works in the night. Sometimes batterires run out in the night. And then the CO2 detector's low battery alarm blares.  Until you can sleep-drunkenly pull enough fuses to make it stop.  Dogs and kids love that.
