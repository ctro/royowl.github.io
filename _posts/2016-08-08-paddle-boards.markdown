There's no better way to cool off in the summer than getting wet.
In the mountains we take to our rivers and lakes.

Paddle boards are a great, inexpensive way to enjoy the water.
They are super for beginners because you can start by sitting down or kneeling.
Take yourself, your toddler, or your dog.  Drink beers or do yoga.
Paddling is a good core workout too!

Boards come in two general flavors:  Hard or Soft.

**Hard boards** are faster and more maneuverable. They are also harder to store,  more expensive, and prone to chips, dings, and breaks. They are like surf boards.

**Soft boards** are slower in the water _and_ slower to set up (_read inflate_) but they make up for it in affordability, pack-ability, and toughness.  They are more like river rafts.  

Paddle boarding down rivers is GREAT FUN! Rivers offer another good reason for soft boards: they bounce off rocks!

My family has a couple sets of [Tower Paddle Boards](http://amzn.to/2b9UcC6). They are some of the cheapest paddle boards you can find and ours have held up wonderfully. Check the [Tower website](http://www.towerpaddleboards.com/) for a rundown of their models.  Add a [Custom Backpack](http://amzn.to/2aAY7U0) to wrap up the whole bundle for a hike.

I've seen TONS of these paddle boards on rivers and lakes in Grand Teton National Park.  I think people are catching on.

Pull up to String lake with your paddle boards, your [Yeti 20](http://amzn.to/2aKQk5K), and your [ENO Hammmock](http://amzn.to/2b9VwoK) and unpack the good times.

Add a pair of [Von Zipper Lesmore](http://amzn.to/2aHFwJ7) sunglasses because the sun is so bright.
These sunglasses remind me of my favorite RayBans but they are cheaper and so much lighter.
